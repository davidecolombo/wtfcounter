## Overview

Have you ever found yourself knee-deep in a codebase filled with dense spaghetti code, cryptic variable names, and an incoherent coding style? The endless confusion and frustration can lead to an unhealthy number of "WTFs per minute." Fear not, for we present to you the WTF Counter – a simple tool designed to help you keep track of those perplexing moments.

## Features

- **WTF Counter**: A straightforward counter that keeps track of the number of "WTFs" you encounter while navigating through the codebase.

- **Hotkey Integration**: The tool is equipped with a hotkey that allows you to effortlessly increment the counter whenever you come across a particularly bewildering section of code. 

## How to Use

1. **Installation**: Download [binaries](https://github.com/davidecolombo/wtfcounter/releases) or clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/davidecolombo/wtfcounter
    ```

2. **Setup**: Open the code editor of your choice and ensure the tool is integrated into your workflow. You can customize the hotkey according to your preferences.

3. **Usage**: As you encounter confusing code, simply press the configured hotkey, and watch as the WTF counter increments.

4. **Stay Sane**: Keep an eye on the WTF counter to gain insights into the code's overall complexity. It can serve as a humorous yet practical metric to gauge the codebase's maintainability.
